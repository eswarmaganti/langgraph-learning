# Task : Implement an Automatic Higher or Lower Number Guess Game

- Set up the bounds to between 1 and 20. The graph has to keep guessing (max number of guesses is 7) where if the guess is correct, then it stops, but if not we keep looping until we hit the max limit of 7.
- Each time a number is guessed, the hint node should say higher or lower and the graph should account for this information and guess the next guess accordingly.

```commandline
input: { "player_name": "John", "guesses": [], "attempts": 0, "lower_bound": 1, "upper_bound": 20 } 
```
