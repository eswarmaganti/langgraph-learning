# Objectives
1. Implement conditional logic to route the flow of data to different nodes
2. use START and END nodes to manage entry and exit points explicitly.
3. Design multiple nodes to perform different operations (addition, subtraction, ...)
4. Create a router node to handle decision-making and to control graph-flow
